# Conway's Game Of Life

The application can be accessd at - https://iamsurajgharat.github.io/conways-game-of-life/

## Concept

The application gives a pictorial view of the cellular automation devised by the British mathematician John Conway. As of now, the application only supports certain fixed shapes such as Blinker, Glider and Pulsar etc., but in future I would like to build an ability for users to draw any initial shape onto the screen on which the automation rules would be applied.

For more details about the concept in general, please visit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Why

The primary intention behind this project was to learn front end technologies such as Javascript, Typescript, and Angular, to the extent where I could start building complete end to end applications, and deploy it on any available cloud.
